To edit the main window in this example, open the ui_mainwindow.ui in the resources directory 
with the Qt Designer application. If you have installed PySide6, just search for designer.exe 
to find it.

When you have made your changes to the .ui file, you manually have to run the fixui.py to 
process and distrubute the resulting file throughout the project. Just type:

    python fixui.py
